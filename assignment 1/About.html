    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Hi there! I’m Krishan, a traveler at heart and a seeker by soul.
Through this blog, I share my journey of exploring new places, cultures, and the deeper meanings of life that travel reveals along the way.

For me, travelling isn’t just about visiting destinations — it’s about connecting with people, nature, and my own inner self. Each trip teaches me something new — whether it’s the calm of the mountains, the energy of a crowded city, or the silence of a temple.

I believe that every journey, big or small, can be spiritual if we travel with awareness and gratitude.
Here, you’ll find stories, reflections, and travel guides inspired by my adventures — moments that have shaped me and continue to remind me that the world is both vast and deeply connected.

So, whether you’re here for travel tips, soulful stories, or just a spark of inspiration — welcome aboard! Let’s wander, wonder, and grow together.

Thank you for being part of my journey.</p>
